    <p>A wild Pikachu appeared! Who's that pokemon? Gotta catch 'em all! Prepare for trouble. We, Team Rocket, are
      Pokemon gangsters! I hate to admit it, but you are a Pokemon master! I don't often come here, but I will fight
      you. I know! I'll use my frying pan as a drying pan! Pikachu ran away!</p>
